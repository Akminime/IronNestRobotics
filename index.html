        <h2>What is FTC?</h2>
        <p>First Tech Challenge (FTC) is an exciting robotics competition designed for high school students who have a passion for technology and engineering. In FTC, teams of students are challenged to design, build, and program a robot to compete in various tasks and challenges. These challenges change from season to season, offering students the opportunity to tackle new and innovative problems. FTC not only provides a hands-on learning experience in robotics and engineering but also emphasizes teamwork, problem-solving, and gracious professionalism. Teams are encouraged to collaborate and help each other, fostering a sense of camaraderie within the robotics community. The competition culminates in regional, state, and even national championships, where teams showcase their robots and compete for top honors. FTC is not just about building robots; it's about inspiring the next generation of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) leaders. If you're a high school student at West Anchorage Highschool interested in coding, robotics, and computer science, FTC is an excellent way to explore these passions and gain valuable skills that can benefit you in the future.</p>
